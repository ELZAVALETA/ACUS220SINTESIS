# ACUS220 SINTESIS

VST GRANULAR SYNTHESIS PROJECT

#INTRODUCTION
this project aims to develop a VST plugin that combines granular synthesis and spectral compression to create unique sound textures and transformations. The goal is to design a flexible and creative tool that allows users to manipulate audio at a deep level, exploring the rich sonic possibilities of both synthesis techniques.

Granular synthesis will be used to break audio into tiny grains, enabling time-stretching, pitch manipulation, and textural effects.

Spectral gate will allow users to modify the frequency components of sounds, enabling smooth morphing and resynthesis.

The project will involve coding the plugin from scratch, implementing real-time processing, and designing an intuitive user interface for musicians and sound designers.
